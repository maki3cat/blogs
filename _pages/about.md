This is Maki, a very **nice INTJ**.

**Computer science** is a keyword of my life. I work as a backend software engineer. I like computer science; have passion and commitment; and I think it is good luck to combine work with interest. I started as a self-taught developer with a BS in Economics, worked in Airwallex and ByteDance for many years, and then self-funded myself to the United States for a Master's in Computer Science. 

Right now, I am trying to focus my career more on **system/infra engineering**, especially for new potentials in the AI-era. And I start with my [open-source](https://github.com/maki3cat) projects while looking for more academic and industry opportunities at the same time.

I am the first in my family to attend university (top 10 in China), and the first in my extended family to study abroad in the U.S. I am also bringing significantly positive changes to my family. People who know me say I should be proud of myself. Maybe they are correct; still, I hope I can be better than this.

A few words about life. **Working out** is an important part of my everyday life, and I'm trying to find more opportunies of paddling and hiking. I am a supporter of **animal welfare**, and have been donating monthly to related NGOs for 3+ years. I am a fan of video games which is definitely a form of art, and my top 3 favorite games are Zelda, The Witcher 3, Bloodborne/Elden Ring. I used to travel regularly before the pandemic; and I am resuming it.
