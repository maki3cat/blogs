Maki passed the road testing today! Ready to receive my US driving license!
Got a lot of help from friends in the urgent 3 days practice in renting a car, practicing maneuverability, and road driving. Really appreciate these nice people's help.
(OH's new state law will stop foreigners having the test which will be effective the day after tomorrow).
The examiner was a very very nice girl, and I felt relaxed and supported instead of being judged and checked out sitting by her side.
And I got full score for maneuverability (thanks to Heng's guidance and help)!
